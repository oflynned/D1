\section{Abstract}
Lab D1 introduces the concept of circuitry simulation in the MultiSim 13.0 environment, and theory associated with the Bipolar Junction Transistor within various characteristics spanning current-voltage, transfer characteristics, and dynamic properties within the inverter itself.
\section{BJT Current - Voltage Characteristics}
\subsection{Theory}
\subsubsection{What is a Bipolar Junction Transistor?}
Transistors are a fundamental part of electronics in the modern day. They may act as switches, control digital information, as well as within amplifiers. BJTs are generally used for small loads typically less than 1 amp of current. 

A \emph{Bipolar Junction Transistor} is a transistor that is subject to both hole and charge carriers under two types of manufacture: \emph{NPN} and \emph{PNP}. A BJT pertains to that of providing a means of gain in current amplification which allows the component to be used in integrated circuits as either a switch or amplifier, therefore giving it a large range of uses in electronic equipment.

There are three regions within a BJT: \emph{emitter}, \emph{collector}, and \emph{base}, each denoted by a specific pin on the component. A typical operation of excitation occurs in the base-emitter junction when \emph{forward-biased}, which corresponds to that of the p-doped side of the junction being more positive than the n-doped side. This also entails that the base-collector junction is reverse biased.

\subsubsection{Worked Example}
Many of the terms used within the lecture notes stem from this base theory:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $V_{cc}$ - Voltage at collector
\item $I_{b}$ - Base current
\item $V_{be}$ - Voltage from base to emitter
\end{enumerate}

This is where $V_{cc}$ comes from; it indicates the positive supply at the collectors of all of the collectors inside of an integrated circuits. Say you have a transistor and apply a voltage at a base, conencting the emitter to the ground, which allows \emph{1mA} to flow from the base to the emitter enroute to the ground:
\begin{align*}
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{vbe.png}
\quad
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{vce.png}
\end{align*}

The key to this transistor is that 100mA flows from the collector to the emitter. The relationship between these two currents is known as the gain of the transistor. For example, for a 2N3904 BJT, the datasheet states that its gain (also known as $\beta$ or \emph{hFE}) should be 100, varying under different conditions and should be treated as a guideline to follow, whilst not being an absolute rule. Using a simple formula, its possible to calculate the maximum current that the transistor will allow through its collector to its emitter:
$$I_C=I_B*\beta$$
But how do we know what the base current should be? Within a BJT, there is a set of diodes that must be limited in their current in order to work correctly as intended. A standard diode has a forward voltage of about 0.7V. Therefore the current limiting resistor must drop to approximately 2.6V in order to function correctly under Ohm's Law.
$$V_F=3.3V-0.7V=2.6V$$
Using the law, the resistance can be calculated:
$$R=\frac{V_R}{I_B}=\frac{2.6V}{1mA}=2600\Omega$$
\begin{align*}
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{motor.png}
\end{align*}
This demonstrates two capabilities of the BJT:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It amplifies current by turning 1mA into 100mA
\item It acts as an electronic switch
\end{enumerate}
The above example uses a NPN transistor. A PNP transistor acts similarly, but as seen below, the diodes are inverted and thus behaves in a different manner to that of the NPN transistor, where the arrow on the diagrams point in the direction of the N part of the transistor itself.

\subsubsection{Semiconductor Doping}
Semiconductor doping is the addition of a small percentage of foreign atoms into the regular crystal lattice of silicon or germanium in order to produce dramatic changes in their electrical properties. The addition of doping to a semiconductor creates what is called an N-type or P-type semiconductor, depending on the context of additions.

An impure atom with 5 valence electrons, also called a \emph{pentavalent impurity}, produces an N-type semiconductor by contributing extra electrons that remain in majority.

Impurity atoms with 3 valence electrons, also called a \emph{trivalent impurity}, produces a P-type semiconductor by requiring an electron, and thereby creating a \emph{hole} that must be filled.
\subsubsection{PNP \& NPN}
\subsection{Terminology}
\subsubsection{Applied Electricity}
\begin{itemize}
\item Voltage:
\begin{itemize}
\item Voltage is the different in electric potential energy of a unit charge transported between points a and b.
\end{itemize}
\item Current:
\begin{itemize}
\item Current is the flow of electroms in Coulombs per second (and thus denoted by ampere) past a specific point in an orderly movement electrically.
\end{itemize}
\item Ground:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ground is a reference point for which excess charge may exit the circuit.
\end{itemize}
\item Diode:
\begin{itemize}
\item A diode is a component in electronics that consists of two electronodes: an anode and cathode. It is a semiconductor by its material makeup, and can be used to prevent sudden voltage changes and protects other components.
\end{itemize}
\item Pulse Voltage:
\begin{itemize}
\item Pulse voltage is a burst of energy with a well-defined shape. It consists of having a decay, and may form a pulse train by which the time between each subsequent pulse is a constant pulse interval.
\end{itemize}
\item Switching Speed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Switching speed is the time denoted for the duration of change from state a to state b resulting in a synthesized output that is usable for the specific output requirements.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Semiconductor Theory}
\begin{itemize}
\item NPN:
\begin{itemize}
\item NPN transistors have a positive voltage at the base and a negative one at the emitter due to its polarity between the base and the emitter ($V_{BE}$). The collector supply voltage is positive with respect to the emitter ($V_{CE}$). Electrons are the most important carriers for NPN.
\end{itemize}
\item PNP:
\begin{itemize}
\item A PNP transistor is one where polarities are reversed, and its current sinks into its base. This differentiates itself with respect to the NPN transistor by having holes as the most important carrier for the PNP transistor.
\end{itemize}
\item $\beta$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Gain, $\beta$, corresponds to the ratio of change in the signal level between input and output. In the case that $\beta=1$, the net current output has increased by the ratio n.
\end{itemize} 
\item $\beta_f$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This corresponds to the forward-gain of the device in forward active mode. Gain is subject to factors such as temperature and other environmental factors with respect to conditions. $\beta_f$ is approximately equivalent to the ratio of DC collector current to the DC base current in forward active mode of operation. 
\end{itemize}
\item $\beta_r$:
\begin{itemize}
\item The bias conditions subject to reverse active mode correspond to the emitter and collector regions switching roles and causing a significantly smaller $\beta$ than in forward active mode.
\end{itemize}
\item $T_f$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the time associated with electronics crossing the transistor junction in forward active mode.
\end{itemize}
\item $T_r$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the time associated with electronics crossing the transistor junction in reverse active mode.
\end{itemize}
\item $C_{je}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_{je}$ refers to the equilibrium of system within the base-emitter region of the BJT transistor noted that there is a void of majority charges within this region of operation.
\end{itemize}
\item $C_{jc}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item $C_{jc}$ is referred to as the system's equilibrium pertaining to being void of all majority charges within the base-collector region of operation.
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{be}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the voltage associated with the base-emitter region of operation within the transistor, which is generally used to find a transistor's DC values and thresholds. Its value depends greatly on the material, ie $V_{be}\approx0.7V$ for Silicon, while for Germanium $V_{be}\approx0.3V$
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{be cut-in}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This value corresponds to when the voltage becomes significant enough to cause an excitation and impulse response within the component. The voltage measured before this value implies that the current supplied is insignificant to the circuit and causes no effect.
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{be sat}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This value resides on the opposite spectrum to $V_{be cut-in}$. It is the region reached when $V_{be}$ becomes greater than 0.7V. Applying a greater voltage beyond this point may cause an adverse effect of exponential scaling, thus leading to an extremely high current through the transistor.
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{ce}$:
\begin{itemize}
%needs more, why is it useful?
\item This is the voltage that resides in the collector-emitter region of a bipolar junction transistor.*****
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{ol}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the maximum value of voltage needed in order to return a digital 0 in logic residing below the indeterminate buffer zone where the level is neither 0 nor 1.
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{oh}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the minimum value of voltage needed in order to return a digital 1 in logic, residing above the indeterminate buffer zone of undefined logic.
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{il max}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the maximum input voltage required in order to recognise a logical 0.
\end{itemize}
\item $V_{ih min}$:
\begin{itemize}
\item This is the minimum input voltage required in order to recognise a logical 1.
\end{itemize}
\item Signal swing:
\begin{itemize}
\item The quantity by which a signal changes, ie a measure of its amplitude change over a period of time.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Conclusion
\section{Issues for Consideration}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What are the limitations on the accuracy of your results?} \hfill \\
  MultiSim is a development environment that does not take in environmental factors into account, therefore the values acquired here are absolute under perfect circumstances. In real life, the actual values may differ due to slight differences in manufacture per component, environmental temperature, and so forth.
  \item \textbf{How do the values of parameters measured compare with those obtained in lectures?} \hfill \\
  Human error and rounding results may result in values that are only approximately equivalent to those found in the lecture notes. Therefore it is possible that my results are slightly inaccurate due to discrepancies in knowing what point on a curve to take, even if the result was in a simulated, perfect environment.
  \item \textbf{What are the advantages or disadvantages of circuit simulations such as those carried out in the experiments?} \hfill \\
  The values obtained within the lab were quite similar to those found within the lecture notes. As a general finding, the values found within the lecture slides tended to be more rounded, rather than those obtained in the lab which entailed a larger range of decimals.
  \item \textbf{What are the benefits or drawbacks of circuit simulation and of MultiSim in general as applied ot the design of electronic circuits?} \hfill
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Within the time slot provided, it was a benefit that I was able to create and test a series of 3 circuits in the space of a 3 hour slot. If I were to manually assemble these and test using apparatus from the laboratory, it would have taken substantially longer time intervals than that in a simulated environment.
  \item As a general rule of thumb, it was a drawback that this was entirely simulated and does not adhere to real-world conditions such as non-ideal temperature, wear, and other non-ideal factors that aren't accounted for in the perfect world.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What are the essential elements of good circuit simulation and simulators?} \hfill
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A good circuit simulation is one that effectively tests the circuit to allow the circuit to function as intended in real life without worrying about malfunction.
  \item A good circuit simulator offers a user-friendly UI that allows the user to work effectively and efficiently with the task at hand with a large library of readily-available functions and components for use within the simulation with respect to the current technology available.
  \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{What is the role of the Electronic Engineer in this regard?} \hfill \\
  The electronic engineer must understand a deep level of circuitry in order to accurately build a circuit that functions as required. This also entails a lot of testing such that, within an environment such as MultiSim, that everything works as intended and limits are observed.
